Simple ethernet example

Example description
The ENET example is a simple Ethernet application for sending an Ethernet
packet via the MAC and displaying received broadcast packets.

To use the example, connect a serial cable to the board's RS232/UART port and
start a terminal program to monitor the port.  The terminal program on the host
PC should be setup for 115.2K 8N1. For each packet received, the LED will toggle
and the packets source and destination MAC addresses will be displayed with the
packet type. Pressing any key will send a dummy packet.

Special connection requirements
There are no special connection requirements for this example.
